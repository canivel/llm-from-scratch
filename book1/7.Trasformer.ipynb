    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-LN Architecture**: LayerNorm comes *before* each sub-layer (not after)\n",
    "   - This is what GPT-2 uses\n",
    "   - Makes training more stable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two Sub-Blocks**: Each TransformerBlock has:\n",
    "   - **Attention sub-block**: Allows tokens to communicate\n",
    "   - **FeedForward sub-block**: Processes each token independently\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Residual Connections**: \n",
    "   - Add the input directly to the output\n",
    "   - Creates \"gradient highways\" for deep networks\n",
    "   - Essential for training 12+ layer models\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shape Preservation**: Input and output have the same shape\n",
    "   - This allows stacking multiple blocks!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we'll stack 12 of these TransformerBlocks together with:\n",
    "- Token embeddings\n",
    "- Position embeddings  \n",
    "- Final LayerNorm\n",
    "- Output projection (language model head)\n",
    "\n",
    "...to create the complete **GPT-2 model**! 🚀"
