   "source": "# Fine-tuning to Follow Instructions\n\n## Overview\n\nThis notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model to follow instructions. This process is known as **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** or **Instruction Tuning**, which is a critical step in creating AI assistants like ChatGPT.\n\n### What is Instruction Fine-Tuning?\n\nInstruction fine-tuning transforms a base language model (trained only to predict the next token) into a model that can understand and respond to user instructions. The key differences are:\n\n- **Base Model**: Predicts the next most likely token based on the training corpus\n- **Instruction-Tuned Model**: Understands task descriptions and generates appropriate responses\n\n### What We'll Cover\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and formatting instruction-response pairs\n2. **Dataset Creation**: Building a custom PyTorch Dataset for instruction data\n3. **Batching Strategy**: Implementing custom collate functions with proper padding and masking\n4. **Model Loading**: Loading pre-trained GPT-2 weights\n5. **Training**: Fine-tuning the model on instruction data\n6. **Evaluation**: Testing the model's ability to follow instructions\n\n### The Alpaca Format\n\nWe'll use the popular Alpaca instruction format:\n```\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Input:\n{optional input}\n\n### Response:\n{model output}\n```"

When computing cross-entropy loss, positions with `-100` are excluded.\n\n**Why keep the first padding token?** The first padding token after real content is actually the end-of-text token we added - we want the model to learn when to stop generating!\n\nAdditional features:\n- `allowed_max_length`: Optionally truncate sequences to a maximum length (useful for memory constraints)",

Here are the key lessons:\n\n### What We Learned:\n\n1. **Instruction Format**: The Alpaca format (`### Instruction:`, `### Input:`, `### Response:`) provides structure that helps the model learn when to respond.\n\n2. **Custom Collate Functions**: Variable-length sequences require careful batching with proper padding and masking to avoid training on padding tokens.\n\n3. **Ignore Index (-100)**: PyTorch's cross-entropy loss ignores targets with value `-100`, allowing us to exclude padding from loss calculation.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning vs Pre-training**: \n   - Pre-trained model: Only predicts next tokens, doesn't understand instructions\n   - Fine-tuned model: Follows instructions and generates appropriate responses\n\n5. **Training Efficiency**: With just ~1000 examples and 2 epochs (~30 seconds on GPU), we achieved significant improvement in instruction-following ability.\n\n### Limitations:\n\n- The model may hallucinate factual information (it learned the format, not new knowledge)\n- Small model (124M params) limits capability compared to larger models\n- No RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) for further alignment\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Evaluate using automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, or LLM-as-judge)\n- Try larger models (GPT-2 Medium/Large) for better quality\n- Experiment with more training data or different instruction datasets\n- Apply techniques like LoRA for more efficient fine-tuning"
