    "# Fine-Tuning GPT for Text Classification (Spam Detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: What is Fine-Tuning and Why Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates one of the most powerful techniques in modern deep learning: **fine-tuning a pre-trained language model** for a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea: Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to teach someone to identify spam emails. Would you:\n",
    "- **Option A**: Start with a newborn baby and teach them everything from scratch (language, reading, what email is, what spam looks like...)\n",
    "- **Option B**: Start with an educated adult who already understands language, and just teach them what spam looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously Option B is faster and more effective. **Fine-tuning is Option B for neural networks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Pre-training Creates Useful Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 was pre-trained on ~40GB of internet text using a simple task: **predict the next word**. But this simple task forced the model to learn incredibly rich knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "To predict what comes next in \"The capital of France is ___\"\n",
    "The model must KNOW that Paris is the capital of France.\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict what comes next in \"She was feeling sad, so she ___\"\n",
    "The model must UNDERSTAND human emotions and typical responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict what comes next in \"The function returns None if ___\"\n",
    "The model must COMPREHEND programming concepts.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Fine-Tuning Works So Well\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Training from Scratch | Fine-Tuning Pre-trained |\n",
    "|--------|----------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Data needed** | Millions of examples | Hundreds to thousands |\n",
    "| **Compute cost** | Days/weeks on GPUs | Minutes to hours |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Often worse | Often better! |\n",
    "| **Why?** | Must learn language + task | Language already learned |\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-trained model has learned a **general-purpose representation of language**. Fine-tuning just teaches it to use this representation for our specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "A **spam classifier** that takes any text message and predicts:\n",
    "- `0` = ham (legitimate message)  \n",
    "- `1` = spam (unwanted/scam message)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Why class balance matters and how to handle it\n",
    "2. **Transfer Learning**: How to leverage pre-trained models effectively\n",
    "3. **Model Adaptation**: How to modify a language model for classification\n",
    "4. **Selective Fine-Tuning**: Why we freeze some layers and train others\n",
    "5. **Training Dynamics**: How to monitor and interpret training progress\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We need three key libraries:\n",
    "- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model training\n",
    "- **tiktoken**: OpenAI's fast tokenizer (same one GPT-2 uses)\n",
    "- **transformers**: Hugging Face library (useful utilities)"

    "\n",
    "### Why Data Quality Matters More Than Model Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we touch any model code, we need good data. In machine learning, there's a saying: **\"Garbage in, garbage out.\"** The best model in the world can't learn from bad data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The SMS Spam Collection Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a classic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository containing **5,574 real SMS messages** labeled as \"ham\" (legitimate) or \"spam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Dataset is Good for Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | Benefit |\n",
    "|----------|---------|\n",
    "| **Real messages** | Not synthetic - actual patterns spammers use |\n",

    "def download_and_unzip_spam_data(...):\n",

    "### Why Data Exploration is Critical\n",
    "\n",

    "SMS messages often contain commas! If the file used commas as separators, a message like \"Hey, how are you?\" would be split incorrectly. Tabs are safer delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Look For\n",
    "\n",
    "When you display `df`, examine:\n",

    "1. **Data types**: Are Label and Text both strings? \u2713\n",
    "2. **Missing values**: Any NaN entries? (None in this dataset)\n",
    "3. **Sample messages**: Do they look like real SMS? \u2713\n",
    "4. **Label format**: Exactly \"ham\" and \"spam\"? (Case sensitive!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Messages You'll See\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Ham:**\n",
    "```\n",

    "\"WINNER!! As a valued network customer you have been selected...\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ham     4825    (87%)\n",
    "spam     747    (13%)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This 87/13 split reflects reality - most messages are legitimate! But it creates a problem for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Imbalance is Dangerous\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a lazy model that ALWAYS predicts \"ham\" regardless of input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def lazy_model(message):\n",
    "    return \"ham\"  # Always predict ham\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This terrible model achieves **87% accuracy**! The metrics look good, but the model is useless - it can't detect any spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Accuracy Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Spam Detection | Ham Detection | Accuracy |\n",
    "|-------|---------------|---------------|----------|\n",
    "| Always predict \"ham\" | 0% | 100% | 87% |\n",

    "| **Good classifier** | 95% | 95% | 95% |\n",

    "High accuracy alone doesn't mean your model works! This is why we'll balance the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Impact\n",

    "In spam detection, missing a spam message (false negative) is annoying, but classifying a legitimate message as spam (false positive) could mean missing an important message from a friend or family member. Understanding these tradeoffs is crucial."
